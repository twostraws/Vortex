/// Contains the variables used to configure a Vortex System for use with a `VortexView`.
/// Properties:-
///   - **tags**: The list of possible tags to use for this particle system. This might be the
///     full set of tags passed into a `VortexView`, but might also be a subset if
///     secondary systems use other tags.
///   - secondarySettings: The list of secondary settings for reac secondary system that can be created.
///     Defaults to an empty array.
///   - spawnOccasion: When this particle system should be spawned.
///     This is useful only for secondary systems. Defaults to `.onBirth`.
///   - position: The current position of this particle system, in unit space.
///     Defaults to [0.5, 0.5].
///   - shape: The shape of this particle system, which controls where particles
///     are created relative to the system's position. Defaults to `.point`.
///   - birthRate: How many particles are created every second. You can use
///     values below 1 here, e.g a birth rate of 0.2 means one particle being created
///     every 5 seconds. Defaults to 100.
///   - emissionLimit: The total number of particles this system should create.
///     A value of `nil` means no limit. Defaults to `nil`.
///   - emissionDuration: How long this system should emit particles for before
///     pausing, measured in seconds. Defaults to 1.
///   - idleDuration: How long this system should wait between particle
///     emissions, measured in seconds. Defaults to 0.
///   - burstCount: How many particles should be emitted when a burst is requested.
///     Defaults to 100.
///   - burstCountVariation: How much variation should be allowed in bursts.
///     Defaults to 0.
///   - lifespan: How long particles should live for, measured in seconds. Defaults
///     to 1.
///   - lifespanVariation: How much variation to allow in particle lifespan.
///     Defaults to 0.
///   - speed: The base rate of movement for particles. A speed of 1 means the
///     system will move from one side to the other in one second. Defaults to 1.
///   - speedVariation: How much variation to allow in particle speed. Defaults
///     to 0.
///   - angle: The base direction to launch new particles, where 0 is directly up. Defaults
///     to 0.
///   - angleRange: How much variation to use in particle launch direction. Defaults to 0.
///   - acceleration: How much acceleration to apply for particle movement.
///     Defaults to 0, meaning that no acceleration is applied.
///   - attractionCenter: A specific point particles should move towards or away
///     from, based on `attractionStrength`. A `nil` value here means
///     no attraction. Defaults to `nil`.
///   - attractionStrength: How fast to move towards `attractionCenter`,
///     when it is not `nil`. Defaults to 0
///   - dampingFactor: How fast movement speed should be slowed down. Defaults to 0.
///   - angularSpeed: How fast particles should spin. Defaults to `[0, 0, 0]`.
///   - angularSpeedVariation: How much variation to allow in particle spin speed.
///     Defaults to `[0, 0, 0]`.
///   - colors: What colors to use for particles made by this system. If `randomRamp`
///     is used then this system picks one possible color ramp to use. Defaults to
///     `.single(.white)`.
///   - size: How large particles should be drawn, where a value of 1 means 100%
///     the image size. Defaults to 1.
///   - sizeVariation: How much variation to use for particle size. Defaults to 0
///   - sizeMultiplierAtDeath: How how much bigger or smaller this particle should
///     be by the time it is removed. This is used as a multiplier based on the particle's initial
///     size, so if it starts at size 0.5 and has a `sizeMultiplierAtDeath` of 0.5, the
///     particle will finish at size 0.25. Defaults to 1.
///   - stretchFactor: How much to stretch this particle's image based on its movement
///     speed. Larger values cause more stretching. Defaults to 1 (no stretch).
